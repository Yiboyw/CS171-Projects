### CS171-Projects
These are coding assignments from my Introduction to Computer Science CS171 class. 

The following are a description of the assignments: 

# Guessing Game

You are to think of a number between from 1000-9999. Let's say you chose 3536.

The program will display - "I guess your number is 1219. How many digits did I guess correctly?".

You are to type how many digits 1219 matches with your number 3536. In this case with the number 1219, there are no matches. So you are to type "0" in the program.

The program may then display - "I guess your number is 6519. How many digits did I guess correctly?".

In this case with the number 6519, the 5 in the hundreds place is the same as in 3536. So you are to type "1" in the program.

Now the program may display "I guess your number is 1516. How many digits did I guess correctly?

In this case with the number 1516, the 5 in the hundreds place and the 6 in the ones place are the same as in 3536. So you are to type "2" in the program.

The program will continue to do these steps until it has finally guessed your number, 3536. The program usually arrives at your specific number in around 8-12 guesses. Hope you have fun with this program! :D
